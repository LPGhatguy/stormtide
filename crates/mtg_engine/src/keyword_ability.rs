/// 702.1. Most abilities describe exactly what they do in the card’s rules
///        text. Some, though, are very common or would require too much space
///        to define on the card. In these cases, the object lists only the name
///        of the ability as a “keyword”; sometimes reminder text summarizes the
///        game rule.
